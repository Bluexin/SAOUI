# About Third Parties

This mod includes a few third-party libraries.
Each of them is described in detail (author, license, link to source)
in a markdown file with the name of the library as file name.

 * [GNU-JEL](gnu-jel.md)
 * [PH-CSS](ph-css.md)
 * [LibrarianLib](LibrarianLib.md)

Included third parties class files are shaded under the `saoui/shade` package, apart from LibrarianLib.
